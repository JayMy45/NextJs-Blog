I thought of a path
to be myself
to see someone else
Surviving high on greyhounds
By becoming a caricature

A fictitious novelette of being

Flashing in the distance is 
purpose 
In which I thought I lost
or at least losing 
as my ChilDren steadily
Graduate into adulthood
Where do I stand now?

Where can I be 
Now that 
The best parts of me
are no longer in need

There are no ways back 
to the sound of smiles and
gum-dropped nights of boredom
excited days of normality

Averages just slip through fingers
without a way to catch it?

ALthough with a SliCe of sadness 
I am proud of those I branded new in this world
