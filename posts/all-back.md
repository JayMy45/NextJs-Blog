I tried to tie time Down
By Meticulously planning to measure the Future Now
Still the present unravelled before my very eyes

What an expense...
While time traveling in fast-forward
Towards
Whatever lies ahead
I noticed my time machine was incapable of reverse
So Instead
I could only learn from the past

And visit vivid imagery
stored as memories
that Didn't always last

If you asked me we never truly waste time

EVEN WhEN
